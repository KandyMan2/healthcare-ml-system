    Data validation framework for healthcare machine learning systems.
    
    Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:
    ---------------------------
    In healthcare ML systems, data validation is not just about ensuring data qualityâ€”it's
    a critical compliance and safety requirement. Here's why each component is essential:
    
    1. Schema Validation:
       - Healthcare data often comes from disparate sources (EHRs, lab systems, imaging)
       - Inconsistent schemas can lead to silent failures in ML pipelines
       - Schema validation catches structural issues BEFORE they reach model training
       - This prevents model training on malformed data that could lead to incorrect
         predictions affecting patient care
    
    2. Audit Logging:
       - HIPAA requires comprehensive audit trails of all data access and processing
       - Each validation step must be logged with timestamps and user context
       - Audit logs enable:
         * Compliance verification during regulatory audits
         * Forensic analysis if data breaches occur
         * Debugging of data quality issues in production
       - Logs must be immutable and stored securely per regulatory requirements
    
    3. PHI (Protected Health Information) Detection:
       - Accidental exposure of PHI can result in massive fines and patient harm
       - Even "de-identified" data may contain re-identification risks
       - PHI detection must occur at pipeline ingestion to prevent:
         * Logging sensitive data in plain text
         * Storing PHI in non-compliant systems
         * Leaking identifiers into model training data
       - This is a defense-in-depth strategy: catch PHI before it propagates
    
    Future Extension Points:
    ------------------------
    - Integration with healthcare ontologies (SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, LOINC)
    - Real-time validation streaming for continuous data ingestion
    - Advanced PHI detection using NLP and pattern matching
    - Data quality metrics and monitoring dashboards
    - Cross-field validation rules (e.g., age consistency with birth date)
    - Integration with data lineage tracking systems

        - Missing required fields (e.g., patient ID) can cause data loss
        - Type mismatches (e.g., string instead of numeric lab value) break ML pipelines
        - Out-of-range values may indicate data corruption or measurement errors
        - Invalid relationships (e.g., discharge date before admission) indicate data quality issues
