# Healthcare ML System Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture and design philosophy of the Healthcare ML System. The system is designed to process healthcare data, apply machine learning models for predictions and insights, and provide a scalable, maintainable codebase for healthcare analytics.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Design

The Healthcare ML System follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
healthcare-ml-system/
├── docs/              # Documentation and architecture decisions
├── src/               # Source code
│   ├── data_pipeline/ # Data ingestion, preprocessing, and validation
│   └── models/        # ML model definitions and training logic
├── tests/             # Unit and integration tests
└── config/            # Configuration files
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Pipeline (`src/data_pipeline/`)

**Purpose**: Handle all data-related operations including ingestion, cleaning, validation, and transformation.

**Responsibilities**:
- Ingest raw healthcare data from various sources (EHR systems, CSV files, databases)
- Validate data quality and completeness
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Transform data into formats suitable for ML models
- Handle patient privacy and data anonymization (HIPAA compliance)

**Rationale**: Healthcare data is often messy, incomplete, and comes from multiple sources. A dedicated data pipeline ensures consistent data quality and reduces technical debt by centralizing data processing logic.

#### 2. Models (`src/models/`)

**Purpose**: Define, train, evaluate, and deploy machine learning models for healthcare predictions.

**Responsibilities**:
- Define model architectures (traditional ML and deep learning)
- Implement training and validation workflows
- Handle model versioning and serialization
- Provide inference capabilities
- Track model performance metrics

**Rationale**: Separating model logic from data processing allows for easier experimentation, A/B testing, and model versioning. This modularity enables data scientists to iterate on models without affecting the data pipeline.

## Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By splitting data processing and modeling into separate modules, we enable:
   - Parallel development by different team members
   - Independent testing and debugging
   - Easier maintenance and updates

2. **Scalability**: The modular design allows each component to scale independently:
   - Data pipeline can handle increasing data volumes
   - Models can be deployed on different infrastructure (CPU/GPU)

3. **Healthcare-Specific Considerations**:
   - **Compliance**: Data pipeline includes privacy and security measures
   - **Traceability**: Clear documentation and versioning for regulatory requirements
   - **Validation**: Rigorous testing for patient safety

4. **Maintainability**: Clear directory structure and documentation make onboarding new developers easier and reduce technical debt.

### Design Principles

- **Explainability**: All model decisions should be traceable and explainable for healthcare professionals
- **Reproducibility**: Experiments and results must be reproducible for scientific validity
- **Safety**: Multiple validation layers to prevent errors that could affect patient care
- **Privacy**: Data handling follows HIPAA guidelines and best practices for patient privacy

## Future Considerations

- **API Layer**: Add REST/GraphQL API for model serving
- **Monitoring**: Implement model performance monitoring in production
- **Feature Store**: Centralized feature management for consistency
- **MLOps Pipeline**: Automated training, testing, and deployment workflows
